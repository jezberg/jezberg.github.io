Our topic in the panel was the role of AI in physics and chemistry teaching and research, a subject made even more topical by the announcement of the 2024 Nobel Prize in both chemistry and physics going to work related to AI. My role on the panel was to give an understandable overview of how modern AI (or, more precisely, machine learning) works and its weaknesses regarding the trustworthiness and correctness of the results. You can find my slides below; I am very happy with how the presentation turned out, as many of the participants in the audience seemed to be as well.</p> <p>I would like to thank the conference organizers for the invitation to speak and for a well-organized event. The only thing one could complain about was the extremely strong wind on the way back from Sweden, but as far as I know, physicists and chemists have yet to figure out a way to directly influence the weather on the Ostrobotnian Sea.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQp6L1jFxGZiWoYl73GSPeaB81xCl1SNePn7wYN70miCunqaaTDXfw7LyMr8CXjaf-2fjeZmLdH61OG/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="780" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="events"/><category term="events"/><category term="presentations"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Research for Science Teachers]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mene ja Tiedä</title><link href="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/menejatieda/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mene ja Tiedä"/><published>2024-10-18T10:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-18T10:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/menejatieda</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/menejatieda/"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the year, I was involved in launching <a href="https://menejatieda.fi/">Mene ja Tiedä</a>, a science journal aimed at high school students.

In bi-objective optimization, we are looking for a set of solutions that–informally speaking–balance two objectives as well as possible. An example of a bi-objective optimization problem that we often use is the problem of buying a house or an apartment that, on the one hand, should be as close to the center of town as possible but, on the other, should be as affordable as possible. As these two goals conflict, there is no clear single “best” solution. Instead, we seek solutions that can not be improved in “an obvious way”. In other words, we are interested only in houses for which all cheaper options are further away or for which all closer options are more expensive. The paper shows how to solve problems like these with declarative, constraint-based methods.</p> <p>I want to thank all of my co-authors for their excellent work!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="research"/><category term="papers"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Interested in a PhD?</title><link href="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/student/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Interested in a PhD?"/><published>2024-07-02T10:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-02T10:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/student</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/student/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/doctoral_student.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/doctoral_student.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Thanks to the Academy Research Fellowship that I was <a href="/blog/2024/funding/">recently</a> awarded, I now have the opportunity to hire a doctoral student or possibly a post-doctoral researcher.
