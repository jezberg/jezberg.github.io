	abstract = {Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) is an essential framework for combinatorial optimization at the core of automated reasoning. However, to date, no notable parallelizations with convincing scaling behaviour exist. We suggest to exploit and transfer recent advances in massively parallel SAT solving to perform scalable solution improving search (SIS) for MaxSAT solving. Building upon the distributed job scheduling and SAT solving platform Mallob, we present the first MaxSAT solver that scales to hundreds of cores through a careful combination of parallel and distributed incremental SAT solving, task parallelism and flexible load balancing, and clause sharing within and across SAT solving tasks. Experiments on up to 768 cores (16 nodes) show that our approach clearly outscales state-of-the-art SIS-based MaxSAT solvers, marking a new baseline for parallel MaxSAT solving.},

  abstract 	   =  {We propose symmetric core learning (SCL) as a novel approach to making the implicit hitting set approach (IHS) to constraint optimization more symmetry-aware. SCL has the potential of significantly reducing the number of iterations and, in particular, the number of calls to an NP decision solver for extracting individual unsatisfiable cores. As the technique is focused on generating symmetric cores to the hitting set component of IHS, SCL is generally applicable in IHS-style search for essentially any constraint optimization paradigm. In this work, we focus in particular on integrating SCL to IHS for pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO), as earlier proposed static symmetry breaking through lex-leader constraints generated before search turns out to often degrade the performance of the IHS approach to PBO. In contrast, we show that SCL can improve the runtime performance of a state-of-the-art IHS approach to PBO and generally does not impose significant overhead in terms of runtime performance.},

  abstract 	   = {Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), the constraint paradigm of minimizing a linear expression over Boolean (0-1) variables subject to a set of propositional clauses, is today used for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems in various domains. Especially anytime MaxSAT solvers that compute low-cost solutions within a limited available computational time have significantly improved in recent years. Such solvers can be divided into SAT-based methods that use sophisticated reasoning, and stochastic local search (SLS) methods that heuristically explore the search space. The two are complementary; roughly speaking, SLS struggles with finding feasible solutions, and SAT-based methods with minimizing cost. Consequently, most state-of-the-art anytime MaxSAT solvers run SLS before a SAT-based algorithm with minimal communication between the two.
In this paper, we aim to harness the complementary strengths of SAT-based, and SLS approaches in the context of anytime MaxSAT. More precisely, we describe several ways to enhance the performance of the so-called core-boosted linear search algorithm for anytime MaxSAT with SLS techniques. Core-boosted linear search is a three-phase algorithm where each phase uses different types of reasoning. Beyond MaxSAT, core-boosted search has also been successful in the related paradigms of pseudo-boolean optimization and constraint programming. We describe how an SLS approach to MaxSAT can be tightly integrated with all three phases of the algorithm, resulting in non-trivial information exchange in both directions between the SLS algorithm and the reasoning methods. We evaluate our techniques on standard benchmarks from the latest MaxSAT Evaluation and demonstrate that our techniques can noticeably improve on implementations of core-boosted search and SLS.},

  abstract 	   = { Due to the wide employment of automated reasoning in the analysis and construction of correct systems, the results reported by automated reasoning engines must be trustworthy. For Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers—and more recently SAT-based maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solvers—trustworthiness is obtained by integrating proof logging into solvers, making solvers capable of emitting machine-verifiable proofs to certify correctness of the reasoning steps performed. In this work, we enable for the first time proof logging based on the VeriPB proof format for multi-objective MaxSAT (MO-MaxSAT) optimization techniques. Although VeriPB does not offer direct support for multiobjective problems, we detail how preorders in VeriPB can be used to provide certificates for MO-MaxSAT algorithms computing a representative solution for each element in the non-dominated set of the search space under Pareto-optimality, without extending the VeriPB format or the proof checker. By implementing VeriPB proof logging into a state-of-the-art multi-objective MaxSAT solver,we show empirically that proof logging can be made scalable for MO-MaxSAT with reasonable overhead.

  abstract 	   = {  Proof logging has long been the established method to certify correctness of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers, but has only recently been introduced for SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT). The focus of this paper is solution-improving search (SIS), in which a SAT solver is iteratively queried for increasingly better solutions until an optimal one is found. A challenging aspect of modern SIS solvers is that they make use of complex ``without loss of generality'' arguments that are quite involved to understand even at a human meta-level, let alone to express in a simple, machine-verifiable proof.

  In this work, we develop pseudo-Boolean proof logging methods for solution-improving MaxSAT solving, and use them to produce acertifying version of the state-of-the-art solver pacose with veripb proofs.  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that this approach works in practice.   We hope that this is yet another step towards general adoption of proof logging in MaxSAT solving.

	abstract = {The declarative approach is key to efficiently finding optimal solutions to various types of NP-hard real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Most work on practical declarative solvers—ranging from classical integer programming to finite-domain constraint optimization and maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT)—has focused on optimization under a single objective; fewer advances have been made towards efficient declarative techniques for multi-objective optimization problems. Motivated by significant recent advances in practical solvers for MaxSAT, in this work we develop BiOptSat, an exact declarative approach for finding Pareto-optimal solutions to bi-objective optimization problems, with propositional logic as the underlying constraint language. BiOptSat can be viewed as an instantiation of the lexicographic method. The approach makes use of a single Boolean satisfiability solver that is incrementally employed throughout the entire search procedure, allowing for finding a single Pareto-optimal solution, finding one representative solution for each non-dominated point, and enumerating all Pareto-optimal solutions. We detail several algorithmic instantiations of BiOptSat, each building on recent algorithms proposed for single-objective MaxSAT. We empirically evaluate the instantiations compared to recently-proposed alternative approaches to multi-objective MaxSAT solving on several real-world domains from the literature, showing the practical benefits of our approach.},

	abstract = {Maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT), employing propositional logic as the declarative language of choice, has turned into a viable approach to solving NP-hard optimization problems arising from artificial intelligence and other real-world settings. A key contributing factor to the success of MaxSAT is the rise of increasingly effective exact solvers that are based on iterative calls to a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver. The three types of SAT-based MaxSAT solving approaches, each with its distinguishing features, implemented in current state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers are the core-guided, the implicit hitting set (IHS), and the objective-bounding approaches. The objective-bounding approach is based on directly searching over the objective function range by iteratively querying a SAT solver if the MaxSAT instance at hand has a solution under different bounds on the objective. In contrast, both core-guided and IHS are so-called unsatisfiability-based approaches that employ a SAT solver as an unsatisfiable core extractor to determine sources of inconsistencies, but critically differ in how the found unsatisfiable cores are made use of towards finding a provably optimal solution. Furthermore, a variety of different algorithmic variants of the core-guided approach in particular have been proposed and implemented in solvers. It is well-acknowledged that each of the three approaches has its advantages and disadvantages, which is also witnessed by instance and problem-domain specific runtime performance differences (and at times similarities) of MaxSAT solvers implementing variants of the approaches. However, the questions of to what extent the approaches are fundamentally different and how the benefits of the individual methods could be combined in a single algorithmic approach are currently not fully understood. In this work, we approach these questions by developing UniMaxSAT, a general unifying algorithmic framework. Based on the recent notion of abstract cores, UniMaxSAT captures in general core-guided, IHS and objective-bounding computations. The framework offers a unified way of establishing quite generally the correctness of the current approaches. We illustrate this by formally showing that UniMaxSAT can simulate the computations of various algorithmic instantiations of the three types of MaxSAT solving approaches. Furthermore, UniMaxSAT can be instantiated in novel ways giving rise to new algorithmic variants of the approaches. We illustrate this aspect by developing a prototype implementation of an algorithmic variant for MaxSAT based on the framework.},

  abstract 	   = {Building on the progress in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving over the last decades, maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) has become a viable approach for solving NP-hard optimization problems. However, ensuring correctness of MaxSAT solvers has remained a considerable concern. For SAT, this is largely a solved problem thanks to the use of proof logging, meaning that solvers emit machine-verifiable proofs to certify correctness. However, for MaxSAT, proof logging solvers have started being developed only very recently. Moreover, these nascent efforts have only targeted the core solving process, ignoring the preprocessing phase where input problem instances can be substantially reformulated before being passed on to the solver proper. In this work, we demonstrate how pseudo-Boolean proof logging can be used to certify the correctness of a wide range of modern MaxSAT preprocessing techniques. By combining and extending the VeriPB and CakePB tools, we provide formally verified end-to-end proof checking that the input and preprocessed output MaxSAT problem instances have the same optimal value. An extensive evaluation on applied MaxSAT benchmarks shows that our approach is feasible in practice.},
