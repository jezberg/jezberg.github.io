The call for papers for the [2025 SAT conference](https://satisfiability.org/SAT25/) is now out. The International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing in one of the central conferences in my field. Next year it will take place in Glasgow in August. I am happy to serve as one of the program chairs together with Professor Jakob Nordstr√∂m, working closely with Ciaran McCreesh who is the local organiser.

I am looking forward to seeing all of my international colleagues in Glasgow.
