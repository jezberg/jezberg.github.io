At the beginning of the year, I had the privilege of being invited to be a part of a panel on AI at [Finlandssvenska fysik- och kemidagarna 2024](http://www.fyskemdagarna.fi/)j, a bi-annual conference for Fenno-Swedish physics and chemistry teachers, researchers, and students that took place in the middle of October. Our topic in the panel was the role of AI in physics and chemistry teaching and research, a subject made even more topical by the announcement of the 2024 Nobel Prize in both chemistry and physics going to work related to AI. My role on the panel was to give an understandable overview of how modern AI (or, more precisely, machine learning) works and its weaknesses regarding the trustworthiness and correctness of the results. You can find my slides below; I am very happy with how the presentation turned out, as many of the participants in the audience seemed to be as well.

I would like to thank the conference organizers for the invitation to speak and for a well-organized event. The only thing one could complain about was the extremelyÂ strong wind on the way back from Sweden, but as far as I know, physicists and chemists have yet to figure out a way to directly influence the weather on the Ostrobotnian Sea.
