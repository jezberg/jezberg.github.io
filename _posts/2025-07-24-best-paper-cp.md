I was very happy to learn, that the paper _Symmetric Core Learning for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization by Implicit Hitting Sets_ by my student Hannes Ihalainen will be awarded the best student paper of the 31st International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming, one of the foremost international conference in my research field.

The paper presents an approach for using the symmetries of an optimization problem in order to speed up search for an optimal solution. The paper summarizes work that was started briefly after my 2020 paper on abstract cores when Bart Bogaerts, one of the co-authors of this paper contacted me.

I would like to congratulate Hannes and thank all of the other people on this paper as well, Bart Boagerts and Matti JÃ¤rvisalo. I look forward to travelling to Glasgow in August and meeting many colleagues and friends.
