The day started at the Vistani encampment. Marillion and Xuza both woke from their respective dreams to discovered that Xuza had changed shape. After a brief conversation Marillion went back to sleep and Xuza joined the night watch, thinking about the nights events (and possibly about cooking)

When the actual morning came, the lost travellers said their farewell to the Vistani and continued onwards toward Vallaki. Their route took them over the Tser falls, past the road leading to Castle Ravenloft and finally through a second gate of Barovia. The party learned that these gates are apparently controlled by Strahd himself, allowing passage to those he sees worthy (or not important enough to block out).

Continuing along the party came across the old windmill. In spite of warnings from Bart and other Barovians they decided to investigate. Nearing the windmill the lost travellers observed an. increase in ravens circling it and the nearby megaliths, and a decrease in plant and animal life. The animals travelling with the party also seemed a bit distressed, but calmed down after a while.

Inside the windmill the party encountered Bella and Ofallia, the daughters of Morgantha, the old woman who was selling pies in Barovia. Bella especially seemed interested in selling more pies to the party members and especially Xuza who had found an liking to them seemed interesting in buying them.

The atmosphere in the windmill seemed a bit off though, after some time they realized that the two girls had a barrel of human bones in the tavern. Questions about these naturally lead to sa skirmish, during which Morgantha also arrived back at the windmill. The fight ended with Bella and Ofelia dead and a furious Morgantha disappearing to the ethereal plane, not before making some sinister comments about Goeff.

In the investigation that followed the party recovered 3 potions, Laughter, Youth and Mothers Milk. they also found a kidnapped boy who introduced himself as Freek. Apparently Freek had been taken with his sister from the town of Barovia in exchange for the pies. The party decided to help him get to the Orphanage in Vallaki. Finally, they also obtained the recipe for the pies that were sold by Morgantha and learned that fresh human bone dust apparently was a central ingredient in them.

The party decided to spend some time burning the interior of the windmill in order to make it more difficult for Morgantha to restart her business and then spent the night at the windmill.
In the night, thanks to some clever sorcering, the party managed to capture one of the ravens and learned that it is a wereraven working for a secret organization. The captured raven urged the party to ask more questions from Urwin Martikov in Vallaki.
