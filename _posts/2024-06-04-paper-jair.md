I am happy let you know that our paper _Unifying SAT-Based Approaches to Maximum Satisfiability Solving_ has been accepted for publication in the [Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair), one of the most prestigious journals in my field. The paper is an extension of our [IJCAI](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/215) paper from last year. We present a new framework that unifies three distinct types of optimisation algorithms, that have so far been viewed separately: the so called solution improving approach, core-guided search, and implicit hitting set-based approaches. The framework provides new insights on the relationship between the three, allows for unified proofs of correctness, and serve as basis for new instantiations of such search algorithms. Once the paper has gone through copyediting I will link to it from here.

I would like to thank all of my co-authors on the project for their great work!
