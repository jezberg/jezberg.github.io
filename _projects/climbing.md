While I enjoy exercising in general, I often need quite a lot of motivation to exercise alone. Thus, I am very happy to have found my way into climbing a few years ago. Since rope climbing requires at least two people, any personal lack of motivation is overruled by the social pressure of showing up so that my climbing partner can climb.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

In addition to climbing myself, I like photographing other people who are climbing. I especially like the challenge of setting up nice angles that allow for interesting pictures without jeopardizing the photographer's security. Photographing while hanging from ropes on a wall is also a significant physical challenge, so even when photographing others, I get a workout, too.

    I also like to do outdoors climbing from time to time. While much more difficult than indoors, I do like being outdoors.
