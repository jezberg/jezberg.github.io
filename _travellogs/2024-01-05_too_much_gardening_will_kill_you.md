The day started with the Lost Travellers waking up to find a sickly Goeff who had suffered from nightmares to the extend of looking pale (and with a decreased MaxHP...). Worried about this the party decided to seek out Jeny, a friendly neighbourhood spellcaster living just outside of Vallaki.
As such they set away early on their continued journey toward Vallaki.

Jeny agreed to help the party by some slightly higher level magic, in exchange for them agreeing to get rid of a pesky plant roaming the nearby forrest, charming rabbits and unsuspecting party members. Considering it was only a plant, the Florabarian put up a strong fight, managing to knock a certain warlock from the air with its vines. However, in the end the party emerged victorious, thus settling their dept with Jeny.

Getting back to Jenys hut, they learned that Jeny had been visited by her sister Morgantha, and thus knew everything what had really been going on in the windmill. In order to safeguard Goeff she had taken him to the St Andrals Church since apparently, Morgantha (and other "unnatural" creatures) would find it difficult to enter it. The party set off to Vallaki in order to confront Urwin Martikov regarding the wereraven they had encountered last night, as well as find Goeff in the church.

Entering Vallaki they found it to be a slightly larger town with the night-life being approximately evenly split between seeking shelter in the church and at the Blue Water Inn.Outside of the church the party saw not only scared townspeople seeking shelter, but also a mysterious robed figure who seemed to be watching everyone. At the church they found not only Goeff, but also Freek andIreena Kolyana who said she had wanted to get away from the mob in Barovia and sought refuge in the church. They also were introduced to Lucian Petrovich, the priest of Vallaki. They learned that neither Morgantha nor Strahd could not indeed enter the church so, with permission from Lucian, they decided that Goeff and Ireena would remain there for the time to come. As for Freek, Cinna took him to the Orphanage and left him in the capable hand of Milivoj, the caretaker.

The party (sans Goeff) reconvened at the Blue Water Inn where Bart confronted his old business friend Urwin about his involvement in a secret organisation seeking to overthrow Strahd. While not fully winning Urwins trust, Bart managed to convince him of their joint interests, so Urwin set a task for them to do, they were to travel to the house of the dragon located south of Vallaki in order to gain more information about Strahd. Additionally, with the help of Lucian and Cinnas prior knowledge, the party had also heard of the possibility of finding---the mad mage of mount Baratok----a magic user powerful enough to stop Morgantha north of Vallaki. One third possibility to explore was the Wizzard of Wines from which Bart had not heard anything for a while.

With their options open, the party decided to spend the night at the Inn. During the night, Marrilion again had some unpleasant dreams involving being pushed down a tower by a cleric.
