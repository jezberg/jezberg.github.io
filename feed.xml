The aim was to explore the top-rated disc golf courses of Estonia, focusing on courses near Tartu (seeing as the <a href="https://www.discfestival.com/">European Disc Golf Festival 2025</a> was going on in Tallinn).</p> <p>We are all amateurs, so the primary goal of the trip was to have fun and explore some nice courses. From that perspective, the trip was a huge success. We were delighted with the <a href="https://www.hektorstay.com/hostels/en/">Hektor Design Hostel</a> in Tartu, with the nearby restaurants, and the courses we played. The only thing that could have been–slightly–better was the weather, which was either a bit hot for achieving maximal performance on the course, or a bit rainy. But on the whole, a very lovely trip. Thanks to Lasse and Tobbe for organizing and being good company.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/frisbee-1.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/frisbee-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/frisbee-2.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/frisbee-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> My travel companions, both of whom are better at disc golf than me. </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/frisbee-view.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/frisbee-view.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div align="center"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6Kgq_UEie8?si=lz_UGusGV5vPcrmO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <div class="caption"> When the weather was not too hot to (actually) play, it instead looked like this. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="vacation"/><category term="vacation,"/><category term="disc"/><category term="golf,"/><category term="estonia,"/><category term="Tartu"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weekend trip with my friends]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Paper Accepted in SoCS and CP</title><link href="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2025/paper-socs-cp/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Paper Accepted in SoCS and CP"/><published>2025-05-30T10:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-30T10:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2025/paper-socs-cp</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2025/paper-socs-cp/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/CP2025.png" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/CP2025.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>I am happy to let you know that our papers <em>SLS-Enhanced Core-Boosted Linear Search for Anytime Maximum Satisfiability</em>, <em>From Scalable SAT to MaxSAT: Massively Parallel Solution Improving Search</em> and <em>Symmetric Core Learning for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization by Implicit Hitting Sets</em> have been accepted at the <a href="https://socs25.search-conference.org/">The 18th International Symposium on Combinatorial Search</a> and <a href="https://cp2025.a4cp.org/index.html">The 31st International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming</a>.</p> <p>The papers describe a massively distributed search algorithm for Maximum Satisfiability, a method of incorporating symmetry reasoning in an implicit hitting set approach that does not decrease performance, and an empirical study of combining SLS methods with CDCL reasoning.

Naturvetenskaper Nu is an annual course at the Faculty of Science that invites researchers from the natural sciences to present their research to undergraduate and high-school students. My talk was titled “How can we know if the computer is right?”. The presentation is loosely based on the abstract I wrote for the <a href="https://menejatieda.fi/sv/kan-vi-vara-sakra-pa-att-datorn-har-ratt/">Mene ja Tiedä</a> journal published by the Young Academy of Finland, which in turn is based on our work on certifying the computations of NP-hard optimization procedures (e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-38499-8_1">this paper</a>).</p> <p>I was happy with how the presentation turned out, and I would like to thank the course organizers (mainly Stefan Taubert) for the opportunity, as well as Frida Hartman, who gave the second computer science talk on fairness in AI.

Our topic in the panel was the role of AI in physics and chemistry teaching and research, a subject made even more topical by the announcement of the 2024 Nobel Prize in both chemistry and physics going to work related to AI. My role on the panel was to give an understandable overview of how modern AI (or, more precisely, machine learning) works and its weaknesses regarding the trustworthiness and correctness of the results. You can find my slides below; I am very happy with how the presentation turned out, as many of the participants in the audience seemed to be as well.</p> <p>I would like to thank the conference organizers for the invitation to speak and for a well-organized event. The only thing one could complain about was the extremely strong wind on the way back from Sweden, but as far as I know, physicists and chemists have yet to figure out a way to directly influence the weather on the Ostrobotnian Sea.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQp6L1jFxGZiWoYl73GSPeaB81xCl1SNePn7wYN70miCunqaaTDXfw7LyMr8CXjaf-2fjeZmLdH61OG/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="780" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="events"/><category term="events"/><category term="presentations"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Research for Science Teachers]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mene ja Tiedä</title><link href="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/menejatieda/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mene ja Tiedä"/><published>2024-10-18T10:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-18T10:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/menejatieda</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/menejatieda/"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the year, I was involved in launching <a href="https://menejatieda.fi/">Mene ja Tiedä</a>, a science journal aimed at high school students.
