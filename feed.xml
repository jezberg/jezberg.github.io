Over the following weeks, I will be traveling quite a lot. Tomorrow, I am going to Brusells to visit Prof. Bart Bogaerts, and the week after that, I’ll be in India for the <a href="https://satisfiability.org/SAT24/">SAT 2024</a>. Finally, in the first week of September, I’ll go to Girona for <a href="https://cp2024.a4cp.org/index.html">CP 24</a>. I am both excited and terrified about the upcoming weeks. I am excited to start my <a href="/blog/2024/funding/">Academy Research Fellowship</a>, but terrified about how many hours I’ll spend in an airplane.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/flatanger4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/flatanger4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/flatanger4-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/flatanger4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>During the summer, I went on my first climbing trip.

In bi-objective optimization, we are looking for a set of solutions that–informally speaking–balance two objectives as well as possible. An example of a bi-objective optimization problem that we often use is the problem of buying a house or an apartment that, on the one hand, should be as close to the center of town as possible but, on the other, should be as affordable as possible. As these two goals conflict, there is no clear single “best” solution. Instead, we seek solutions that can not be improved in “an obvious way”. In other words, we are interested only in houses for which all cheaper options are further away or for which all closer options are more expensive. The paper shows how to solve problems like these with declarative, constraint-based methods.</p> <p>I want to thank all of my co-authors for their excellent work!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="research"/><category term="papers"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Interested in a PhD?</title><link href="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/student/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Interested in a PhD?"/><published>2024-07-02T10:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-02T10:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/student</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/student/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/doctoral_student-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/doctoral_student-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/doctoral_student-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/doctoral_student.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Thanks to the Academy Research Fellowship that I was <a href="/blog/2024/funding/">recently</a> awarded, I now have the opportunity to hire a doctoral student or possibly a post-doctoral researcher.
