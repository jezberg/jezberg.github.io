As of the 1st of September of 2021 I will be an [Academy Reseach Fellow](https://www.aka.fi/suomen-akatemian-toiminta/ajankohtaista/tiedotteet-ja-uutiset/2024/luonnontieteiden-ja-tekniikan-tutkimuksen-akatemiatutkijat-ja-akatemiahankkeet-on-valittu/)
at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/computer-science) of the University of Helsinki.
My research is funded by a highly competitive (14%-acceptance rate) Academy Research Fellowship funded by the [Research Council of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/en/). I am a senior member of the
[Constraint Reasoning and Optimization](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization) group led by Professor Matti JÃ¤rvisalo.

Before I was splitting my time between an Research Council Funded funded
postdoctoral position (70%), and an University Lecturer position (30%).
