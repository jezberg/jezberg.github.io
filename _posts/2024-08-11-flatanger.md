The summer holidays are over in Finland, and I am getting back to work. Over the following weeks, I will be traveling quite a lot. Tomorrow, I am going to Brusells to visit Prof. Bart Bogaerts, and the week after that, I'll be in India for the [SAT 2024](https://satisfiability.org/SAT24/). Finally, in the first week of September, I'll go to Girona for [CP 24](https://cp2024.a4cp.org/index.html). I am both excited and terrified about the upcoming weeks. I am excited to start my [Academy Research Fellowship]({% link _posts/2024-06-17-funding.md %}), but terrified about how many hours I'll spend in an airplane.

During the summer, I went on my first climbing trip. We took the ferry to Sweden and drove 12 hours to Flatanger in Norway. There, we climbed for four days before coming back. I had never been on a climbing trip before. It was nice but also intense. Flatanger was very beautiful. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes spending time in nature. If you do go, I can also warmly recommend that you stay at [Flatanger Camping](https://flatangercamping.no/).
