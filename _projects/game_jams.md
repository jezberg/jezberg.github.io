The goal with a "game jam" is similar to that of a (musical) jam session, to come together and make a videogame, or a non-digital (analog) game like a board game or card game. Participants rapidly prototype game designs and inject new ideas to help inspire and grow the global game industry. Every game jam has a theme that is shared by all participants.

I have participated in the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) in total four times between 2015 and 2021. Each tiem I've had a ton of fun. **Thank you** everyone who I have jamed with.

Here are some example gameplay videos from (the more visually impressive) games I've been a part of making. A full list of the game I have joined in making can be found on [my profile page](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/users/jeremias-berg)on the GGJ site.

   Laborinth is an assymetric online heist game in which someone plays a security guard that can set of traps in corridors fro the heisters to look out for. I am very proud of the concept.

If you want to try laborinth for yourself, I reccomend the [newest version](https://github.com/HeavenlyAwe/laborinth) in which we've fixed the lag issues that can be observed in the video.
