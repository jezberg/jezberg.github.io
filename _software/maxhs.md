During my visit to Toronto in 2019. We worked on extending the implicit hitting set (IHS) algorithm
for MaxSAT with abstract cores. Abstract cores which can be seen as a hybridization between core-guided and hitting set-based algorithms, as well as symmetry breaking. The work was recognized with a paper award at the 2020 SAT conferece, the flagship conference of the research field of Boolean satisfiability.

We show how adding abstract cores into the MaxSAT solver [MaxHS](https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/2020/mse20-solver-src/complete/MaxHS.zip)
significantly improves its performance. The solver took top positions in the 2020 and 2021 [MaxSAT Evaluations](https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/). More recently, we have shown how abstract cores can be used as a basis for a framework that unifies most of the existing SAT-based MaxSAT algorithms.

MaxHS is available [on the MaxSAT Evaluations webpage](https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/2020/mse20-solver-src/complete/MaxHS.zip).
