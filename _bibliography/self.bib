	abstract={Building on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solving algorithms, several approaches to computing Pareto-optimal MaxSAT solutions under multiple objectives have been recently proposed. However, preprocessing in (Max)SAT-based multi-objective optimization remains so-far unexplored. Generalizing clause redundancy to the multi-objective setting, we establish provably-correct liftings of MaxSAT preprocessing techniques for multi-objective MaxSAT in terms of computing Pareto-optimal solutions. We also establish preservation of Pareto-MCSes - the multi-objective lifting of minimal correction sets tightly connected to optimal MaxSAT solutions - as a distinguishing feature between different redundancy notions in the multi-objective setting. Furthermore, we provide a first empirical evaluation of the effect of preprocessing on instance sizes and multi-objective MaxSAT solvers.}
