We show that core-boosting significantly improves the performance of several state-of-the-art approaches to computing pareto-optimal solutions to multi-objective optimization problems. Once the camera-ready paper is submitted, it will be made available on these webpages as well.</p> <p>I would like to thank all of my co-authors for their work. Looking forward to going to Uppsala in May.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="papers"/><category term="research"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[i.e. the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I Participated in EDUCA</title><link href="https://jezberg.github.io/blog/2024/educa/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I Participated in EDUCA"/><published>2024-01-26T10:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-26T10:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jezberg.github.io/blog/2024/educa</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jezberg.github.io/blog/2024/educa/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/educa-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/educa-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/educa-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/educa.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Come find us next to the TIETO scene. </div> <p>Today and tomorrow I will be representing the <a href="https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/">meet a researcher</a> initiative of <a href="https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/">Young Academy of Finland</a> at <a href="https://educa.messukeskus.com/?lang=en">EDUCA</a>, the largest convention for the education and training sector in Finland.</p> <p>Meet a researcher connects researchers with schools. We organize remote visits by researchers to different subjects in primary and secondary schools. More than 500 researchers have signed up as voulenteers and currently we are reaching over 10 000 students annually. The best part, it is free for teachers to use. If you are a teacher in Finland (or in a reasonable timezone for Finnish researchers) you should try it. If you’re attending EDUCA tomorrow, you should come say hi.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="current-events"/><category term="outreach"/><category term="meet-a-researcher"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The largest event for the education and training sector in Finland]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I was in a podcast on AI</title><link href="https://jezberg.github.io/blog/2024/interviewed/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I was in a podcast on AI"/><published>2024-01-26T10:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-26T10:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jezberg.github.io/blog/2024/interviewed</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jezberg.github.io/blog/2024/interviewed/"><![CDATA[<p>I was interviewed by the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE) for their Q&amp;AI podcast about AI.
