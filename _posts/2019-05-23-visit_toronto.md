Between March and May of 2019 I was a visiting researcher at the University of Toronto in Canada. My visit was hosted by Professor Fahiem Bacchus. The visit was very succesfull, resulting in a best paper award at the 2020 SAT conference.

I wrote extensively about the visit on [my old blog](https://jeremiasberg.wordpress.com/category/resedagbok/)
