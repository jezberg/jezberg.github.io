The paper is an extension of our <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/215">IJCAI</a> paper from last year. We present a new framework that unifies three distinct types of optimisation algorithms, that have so far been viewed separately: the so called solution improving approach, core-guided search, and implicit hitting set-based approaches. The framework provides new insights on the relationship between the three, allows for unified proofs of correctness, and serve as basis for new instantiations of such search algorithms. Once the paper has gone through copyediting I will link to it from here.</p> <p>I would like to thank all of my co-authors on the project for their great work!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="research"/><category term="papers"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Science Outreach in Korso</title><link href="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/outreach-korso/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Science Outreach in Korso"/><published>2024-04-12T10:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-04-12T10:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/outreach-korso</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/outreach-korso/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/korso1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/korso1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/korso1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/korso1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photo by Kaisa Forsell-Lehto </div> <p>Over the last few years I have been involved with <a href="https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/">Meet a Researcher</a> initiative organized my <a href="https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/">Young Academy Finland</a>. The service organizes research visits to classrooms. A teacher can ask for a researcher from a specific subject, after which the coordinator of meet a researcher looks through the pool of interested researchers, and connects a suitable person with the teacher. The teacher then collects questions from their students, and the researcher prepares a 40 minute visit based on those questions. The best part is, the service is free for the teachers!</p> <p>Today I went to visit a classroom in Ruusuvuoren Koulu with just under 10 immigrant students taking preparatory classes in Finnish. It was definitely an interesting glimpse into a world I had not thought too much of before. We talked about what it means to be a researcher, what I study, and what the kids knew about computers. Thanks to the class for having me. I hope I was able to teach the students at least a bit about being a researcher. If you are a researcher looking to train your outreach skills, or a teacher looking for connections to the research community, I highly recommend looking into <a href="https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/">meet a researcher</a>.
