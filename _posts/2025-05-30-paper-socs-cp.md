I am happy to let you know that our papers _SLS-Enhanced Core-Boosted Linear Search for Anytime Maximum Satisfiability_, _From Scalable SAT to MaxSAT: Massively Parallel Solution Improving Search_ and _Symmetric Core Learning for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization by Implicit Hitting Sets_ have been accepted at
the [The 18th International Symposium on Combinatorial Search](https://socs25.search-conference.org/)
and [The 31st International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming](https://cp2025.a4cp.org/index.html).

The papers describe a massively distributed search algorithm for Maximum Satisfiability, a method of incorporating
symmetry reasoning in an implicit hitting set approach that does not decrease performance, and an empirical study of combining SLS methods with CDCL reasoning. I will be linking the papers onto these pages after the conferences in August.

I want to thank all of my co-authors for their excellent work on the projects! I hope to meet many of you in Glasgow.
