After escaping dinner with Strahd and (temporarily) losing Cinna, the lost travelers find themselves in the middle of the Barovian night. After some consideration, they head towards Tser Pools to meet Madam Eva and ask her for guidance. The night is already very dark, but considering recent events, the party decides to push through the night. Pretty soon, the group is caught up by a small bird that relays a message from Cinna saying she is okay and will stay in the castle for a while.

The party pushes on while the night grows even darker, soon realizing they are followed by a swarm of bats. Bart casts sleep on the bats, revealing all but one as actual bats quickly falling from the sky as a consequence of falling asleep. One of the bats resists the spell far better than it ought to, suggesting it to be a vampire in disguise. The group decides to ambush the vampire, who reveals himself as an "old ugly man with a goat tee". The vampire threatens Irena that all those she cares about will be lost before being defeated by the party.

The rest of the journey toward Tser Pools went relatively uninterrupted. The party was met by Daniela, one of Madam Evas's rangers, who led them to the camp and gave them a place to stay. Exhausted, the lost travelers lay down for the rest of the night.

In the morning, Bart went to meet with Eva. Eva handed him a book recently recovered by a second adventuring party and urged the party to visit the amber temple. The rest of the day was spent gathering information about this second adventuring party, reading what turned out to be Mordenkainens journal, and relaxing.
