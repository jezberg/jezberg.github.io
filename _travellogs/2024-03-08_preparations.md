The lost travelers gather allies and prepare to run an ancient ritual designed to imprison a dark power, with Strahd's wedding and Irenas fate looming over them. To maximize confusion and their chance of success, the travellers asked Ezmeralda and Rictavio to simulatenously launch an attack on the Strahds Heart of Sorrow, his extra source of life force. They also asked Tepurin the bard to be their eyes on the inside of the castle and their wedding, notifying them of disturbances and of the best time to launch the attack. Cinna and Darren also met with the werewolves and learned that Strahd had coerced them to attend the wedding and dispose of the less-wanted guests. Darren pleaded for the wolves to ignore this and instead join the assault on Strahd by kidnapping Irena before the wedding.
During all of this, Marillion visited the burgomaster's house to get a doll of Ireena from the former Izek's room. With the doll in hand, Marillion went to Blinsky and asked him to make a life-sized one, hoping to fool at least some vampires Strahd would surely send after the werewolves and the fleeing Irena. 

After a long day of planning, the travelers retired for what could be the last night of sleep in a somewhat comfortable bed they would ever get.
