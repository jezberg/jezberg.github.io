The lost travelers woke up the next day at the Blue Water Inn, utterly destroyed by the wilderness the day before. The group decides to rest the day before their next attempt at the wilderness. Cinna decides to spend the day doing Yoga, and Darren by training with Geoff. The rest of the group is tasked with getting health potions and other supplies for their next attempt at the wilderness.

During the morning, Xuza meets Tepurin and learns more about his past. He learns that Tepurin is currently trying to save his sister Kirya from turning into a vampire after a bite. His best lead is to retrieve a necklace stolen from Jeny by a "ghost" opera singer. As the time his sister has left is running out, Tepurin pleads with Xuza, Bart, and Marillion to help him with a last desperate effort to find the necklace. Following the more precise directions given by Jey, the group set out from Vallaki toward the west. Before leaving the town gates, Marillion decides to blow up a glass orb at the jewelsmith and Bart to purchase a new armor set.

Bart, Xuza, Marillion, and Tepurin make their way to the area described by Jeny. They find what can only be described as a "stage." As this seems like a suitable spot for an egomaniacal ghost to appear, the adventurers camp out, waiting for nightfall. Unfortunately, the opera singer is reluctant to depart with the necklace, so combat breaks out. During the combat, Marillion observes that Xuza's fighting style has changed significantly, almost shifting in and out of existence. In the end, the party again emerges successful, managing to secure not only the necklace but also a headband with another gem. Xuza and Marillion also share some thoughts on Xuzas newfound abilities.

Following an immensely relieved Tepurin back to Vallaki, the smaller group pushes the late hours of the night again to save Kiryan (with Jeny's help). As thanks for their efforts, Bart and Marillion were allowed to keep the gems on the specter's jewelry. They also received Tepurin's cloak, his notes, and a magical flask of coffee.
