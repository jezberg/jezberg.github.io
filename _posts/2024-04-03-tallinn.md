This week, I had the priviledge of representing [Young Academy Finland](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/) in a joint symposium
of the [Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters](https://scientiarum.fi/en/), the [Estonian Academy of Sciences](https://www.akadeemia.ee/en/) and the [Estonian Young Academy of Sciences](https://www.akadeemia.ee/en/eyas/).
I gave a talk presenting the Youbng Academy and heard several interesting presentatiosn from the other participants.
Afterwards we enjoyed a lovely meal with many interesting discussions.

I would like to thank the organizers for their work and the invitation. Tallinn was a very hospitable
country and the locale of the Estonian Academies gorgeous.
