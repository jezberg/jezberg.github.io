I am a [Research Council of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/en/) post doctoral researcher and an university lecturer at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/computer-science) of the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) and a senior member of the [Constraint Reasoning and Optimization](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization) research group.

My research focuses on declarative, constraint-based, approaches and automated reasoning for solving optimization problems. I see my research to lie between theory and practice in that I aim to harness the theory underlying constraint paradigms like Maximum Satisfiability, Pseudo-Boolean Optimization and Constraint Programming toward creating practical tools for solving difficult optimization problems.
