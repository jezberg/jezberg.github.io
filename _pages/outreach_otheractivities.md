# Science Outreach

## Media Appearances

I was interviewed by the Finish Broadcasting Company for a [podcast]({% post_url 2024-01-26-interviewed %}) on the Trustworthiness of AI.

## Meet a Researcher & Mene ja Tiedä

In 2023 - 2024 I was a a board member of Young Academy of Finland in charge of science outreach. As part of that position I am involved with developing and maintaining the [meet a researcher](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/) initiative that coordinates research visits
to schools. The service is very popular, in 2023 year we organized 600 visits and reached over 10 000 students.
In early 2024 I participated in the [EDUCA]({% post_url 2024-01-26-educa %}) conference with the aim of increasing awareness of the service.

I was also involved in launching [Mene ja Tiedä](https://menejatieda.fi/), a science journal
aimed at high school students that seeks to publish summaries of scientific papers written in Finnish and Swedish for high school students. My [abstract on proof-logging combinatorial optimization algorithms](https://menejatieda.fi/sv/kan-vi-vara-sakra-pa-att-datorn-har-ratt/) was among the first ones ever published.

## UniJunior

Since 2020 I have been a member of the steering group of [UniJunior](https://www.helsinki.fi/sv/vetenskapsfostran/barn-unga-och-familjer/unijunior)
a cross-disciplinary project led by Professor Gunilla Holm that studies science workshops for children ages 9-12 as learning environments.

We organize about 10 workshops annually for about 20 children. Each workshop is led by a researcher in some specific subject
and aims to encourage an interest in science in the children. Personally I have organized 4 different workshops:

# Positions of Trust Based on Scientific Merit

- In 2023-2024 I was a board member of [Young Academy Finland](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/), an invite-only society for young researchers
  that invites one computer science researcher per year based on scientific merit.
- Since 2021 I have been a board member of [Finnish Artificial Intelligence Society (FAIS)](https://www.stes.fi/), the official member society of Present Finland in the European
  Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI).
- Since 2020 I have been an expert member of PhD Research Scholarship Selection Committee of Nylands Nation, a student organization at University of Helsinki that
  awards EUR 250k in scholarships annually

## Conference Organization

- In 2025 I will be co-chair of the program committee of the [International Conferences on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT)](http://satisfiability.org/).
- In 2022 I was a local organizer of the [12th International Symposium on Foundations of Information and Knowledge Systems](https://foiks2022.github.io/).
- In 2021 I was chair of the doctoral program of the [27th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming](https://cp2021.a4cp.org/).
  - The doctoral program is a one-day event where the doctoral students can present their work for each other.
- In 2012 I was a local organizer of the [16th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability](http://satisfiability.org/).
