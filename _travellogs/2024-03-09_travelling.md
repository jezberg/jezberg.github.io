The lost travelers set off from Vallaki toward the windmill, where their ritual would take place.
Leaving Vallaki Xuza got in contact with his... patron.... and agreed to become the champion of Shami-Amourae
for long enough to make sure Marillion would not become the champion of Zantras the Kingmaker, in exchange for her leaving him alone afterward.

The travelers arrived at the windmill in the evening. After telling the keepers of the feather stationed there
of their intentions, they spent the rest of the evening setting up for the ritual. Tomorrow would be a big day.
