As I alluded to in my last post, the beginning of fall has been hectic for me. In early August, I went to Belgium for a few days to visit Professor Bart Bogaerts. We talked about various possible research topics and ongoing collaboration. Except for the very hot weather, the visit was very successful and productive.

Afterward, I traveled all the way to India to attend the [SAT 2024](https://satisfiability.org/SAT24/) conference. It was my first time visiting India and only one of a few times visiting Asia. While the taxi rides between Mumbai and Pune were a bit too exciting for me, the rest of the experience was excellent, I especially appreciated making new connections with people in the community. The conference excited me about new research prospects that hopefully will lead to publications soon.

Finally, I went to Girona to attend [CP 2024](https://cp2024.a4cp.org/index.html). On this trip, I was lucky enough to be joined by my spouse, Chride, who made the travel much more enjoyable. Despite some trouble with the trains, we had a lovely time, especially visiting the Ruins of Emp√∫ries, which was very interesting. While there certainly were some exciting papers being presented, the main takeaway for me from the CP conference was still an opportunity to sit down with the other organizers of SAT and CP 2025 to agree on details.

Between Pune and Girona, I also gave a talk on certified automated reasoning at the [Helsinki Algorithms and Theory Days](https://algorithms.fi/theory-days-2024/). You can find my slides on the [presentations](/presentations/) page.

Now I am back in Helsinki for a while, working hard on submissions to TACAS, while also hosting research visitots visitors. More on them in a future post.
