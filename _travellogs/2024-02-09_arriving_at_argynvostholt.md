After a day of "downtime" involving an intensive yoga session, training, or saving the sister of the local bard from turning into a vampire, the lost travelers reunite at breakfast. To postpone the obvious brewing conflict among them, the group heads south toward the house of the dragon at Urvin's behest.

The trip to Argynvostholt is relatively uneventful, albeit long. The group arrives in the evening to find the old mansion in dismay, looking ransacked and hundreds of years old.
During the rest of the evening, the travelers explore the mansion's first floor. They are greeted by the spirit of a dragon urging them to lead its knights to the light. On the bottom floor, they also find (to Xuzas delight) 9 giant spiders and 3 of the aforementioned knights who did not seem to be too interested in being led to the light. With some light "turning-marillion-into-a-monkey" by Cinna and "running through the walls" by Marillion, the group dispatches the revenants. The party then sets up camp in the monastery of Argynvostholt and lies down for a night filled with curious revenant children.
