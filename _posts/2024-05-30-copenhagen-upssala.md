For the last two weeks, I have been traveling. First, I went to the second-ever [WHOOPS](https://jakobnordstrom.se/WHOOPS24/) seminar with my stundent Hannes to hear about the latest developments in pseudo-Boolean proof-logging and discuss our work on unifying Oracle-based constraint optimization methods.
The week after, I participated in the [CPAIOR 2024 conference](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2024), where my student [Christoph](https://christophjabs.info/) presented our work on [multi-objective core boosting]({% post_url 2024-02-16-newpaper %}).

I want to thank the organizers of both events. Looking forward to participating in the upcoming years as well.
