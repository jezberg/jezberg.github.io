The lost travelers set off from Vallaki toward the windmill, where their ritual would occur.
Leaving Vallaki, Xuza gets in contact with his patron and agrees to become the champion of Shami-Amourae for long enough to make sure Marillion will not become the champion of Zantras the Kingmaker. In exchange, Shami was to leave him alone forever.

The travelers arrive at the windmill in the evening. After telling the keepers of the feather stationed there
of their intentions, they spend the rest of the night setting up for the ritual. Tomorrow would be a big day.
