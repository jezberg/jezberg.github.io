At the end of April, I presented in the _Naturveteskaper Nu_ course at the University of Helsinki. Naturvetenskaper Nu is an annual course at the Faculty of Science that invites researchers from the natural sciences to present their research to undergraduate and high-school students. My talk was titled "How can we know if the computer is right?". The presentation is loosely based on the abstract I wrote for the [Mene ja Tied√§](https://menejatieda.fi/sv/kan-vi-vara-sakra-pa-att-datorn-har-ratt/) journal published by the Young Academy of Finland, which in turn is based on our work on certifying the computations of NP-hard optimization procedures (e.g. [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-38499-8_1)).

I was happy with how the presentation turned out, and I would like to thank the course organizers (mainly Stefan Taubert) for the opportunity, as well as Frida Hartman, who gave the second computer science talk on fairness in AI. My slides can be found below.
