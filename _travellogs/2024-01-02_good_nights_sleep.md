During the night Xuza noticed everyone of his fellow party members sleeping very deeply. He was unable to wake them
up, to the extent of the party missing their morning meeting with Ismark KolÂ­yanovic. They did however have some time to buy more pies from Morgantha, an old woman selling pies in the square.

When getting there a bit later, they found the same mob demonstrating outside. Ismark explained, that people from the town had gone missing, latest being Gregor Stanovich. The people in the town believe Strahd is orchestrating these disappearances in an effort to get Ireena Kolyana out of the town. Ismark does not believe this himself, but rather thinks that the culprit might be somewhere closer to town. He urges the party to investigate, starting from Gregors house.

The party set of to do some investigating. Xuxa noticed a sudden urge for some more pies, enough to buy a single piece from Goeff for a significant amount of money.

In an investigation of Gregors house and questioning of the neighbours the party found signs pointing them towards the church. Arriving there they found some suspicious signs and eventually confronted Donavich about them. They learned that his son Doru had been turned into a vampire spawn. Unable to put him out of his misery, Donavich had instead locked him in the basement and brought hium "sustenance". While the party wanted to consult Ismark about what to do, Doru and Donavich made their choices and in the ensuring combat, Doru was put down. After finishing Dooru, the party was confronted by Strahd, who stuck two ghosts on them in a manner that seemed to indicate he was testing them. After the encounter Cinna was behaving a bit suspiciously. Xuza decided to investigate, and learned that she had not been fully forthcoming when it comes to where she lives.

Donavich seemed disturbed about this but did not take any further aggressive action. The party returned to Ismarks house to find that Ireena Kolyana had run away. They spent the night, aiming to start moving west the next day.
