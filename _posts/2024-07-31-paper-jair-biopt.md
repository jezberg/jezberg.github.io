I am happy to let you know that our paper [_From Single-Objective to Bi-Objective Maximum Satisfiability Solving_](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/15333) has been published in the [Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair), one of the most prestigious journals in my field. The paper is an extension of our [SAT](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.SAT.2022.12) paper from a few years ago. We present an algorithmic framework called [BiOptSAT](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/cgss2/src/abstcg/) for computing Pareto-optimal solutions to bi-objective optimization problems with propositional logic as the underlying constraint language. The framework can be instantiated with many different single-objective optimization algorithms. We also demonstrate the competitiveness of BiOptSAT on standard benchmarks.

I would like to thank all of my co-authors on the project for their great work!
