I am a [Academy Research Fellow](https://www.aka.fi/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities-at-a-glance/funding-for-individual-researchers/) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/computer-science) of the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) and a senior member of the [Constraint Reasoning and Optimization](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization) research group.

My research focuses on declarative, constraint-based approaches and automated reasoning for solving optimization problems. It lies between theory and practice. I aim to develop the theory underlying constraint paradigms like Maximum Satisfiability, Pseudo-Boolean Optimization, and Constraint Programming and harness it to create practical and trustworthy tools for solving complex optimization problems.

I earned an M.Sc in applied mathematics in 2014 and a PhD in computer science in 2018 from the University of Helsinki. My PhD-thesis [Solving Optimization Problems via Maximum Satisfiability: Encodings and Re-Encodings](https://helda.helsinki.fi/items/e1c39c7c-c6e2-4e47-b76b-747e4ace524e), was awarded the 2020 [ACP-Doctoral Research award](https://www.a4cp.org/awards/doctoral-research-award).
In 2022, I was awarded a [Title of Docent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docent#Finland) in Computer Science from the University of Helsinki.
