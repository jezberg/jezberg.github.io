The first day after the coup in Vallaki starts with Darren realizing that the bite he received during the encounter with the werewolves had not yet properly healed. Since it does not actively hurt him, he decides to ignore it for now to focus on more urgent matters.

The Travelers start the day by trying to visit Fiona Watcher, only to realize that they are operating under a different assumption from her regarding what would happen if they helped her. Fiona is still upset with Cinna for outing her secrets to her servants and rudely dismisses the group, which the Vistani party members, especially, take offense at.

Seeing as Fiona's cooperation seems unlikely, the travelers decide to steal Nikolaj Sr.'s body and have Jeny resurrect him, as Madam Eva had foretold that he would be an ally. They cook up a plan that—in the end—comes down to Cinna scouting ahead and Bart deadlifting the corpse from the bed to teleport out with it. Against the odds, the plan works. The lost travelers manage to steal Nikolaj Sr.'s body and get it to Jeny by midday. Resurrection is not cheap, but luckily, Cinna had some of Strahd's funds to pay Jeny. After an hour of intensive work by Jeny, Nikolaj Sr is reviewed. The group catches Nikolaj up to the current ongoings and he heads back to town in order to sort out the situation. The travelers soon join them, leaving Cinna with her newfound exercise routine, reconnecting with Nari and perhaps even Strahd.

The group spent the rest of the day gathering strength for an expedition into the dangerous wilderness. Bart and Cinna went to have dinner at the Watcherhaus, while others stayed at the inn. Considering the very hectic two and a half days, the travelers enjoyed their night off.
