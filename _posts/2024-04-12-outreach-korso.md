Today I went to visit a classroom via the [Meet a Researcher](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/) initiative.
The classroom in question was located in Ruusuvuoren Koulu and contained just under 10 immigrant students taking preparatory classes
in Finnish. It was definitely an interesting glimpse into a world I had not thought too much of before. We talked about what it means to be a researcher, what I study, and what the kids knew about computers.

Thanks to the class for having me. I hope I was able to teach the students at least a bit about being a researcher.
If you are a researcher looking to train your outreach skills, or a teacher looking for connections to the research community I highly recommend
looking into [meet a researcher](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/). I have had a blast with it.
