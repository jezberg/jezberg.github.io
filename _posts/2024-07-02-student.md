Thanks to the Academy Research Fellowship that I was [recently]({post_url /_posts/2024-06-17-funding}) awarded, I now have the opportunity to hire a doctoral student or possibly a post-doctoral researcher. Thus, I urge prospective students interested in pursuing a PhD in Helsinki on topics related to my research or post-docs with a background in similar topics to get in touch with a freeform application detailing your background and interest. I welcome applications from people of all backgrounds, ethnicities, and genders. I will, however, ignore generic applications. Ensure you have an understanding of my work and can explain why you would be a good fit as a PhD student or post-doc before getting in touch.
