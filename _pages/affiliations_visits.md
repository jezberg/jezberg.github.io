## Current Position

Since the 1st of September of 2021 I have been working as postdoctoral researcher
at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/computer-science) of the University of Helsinki.
My research is funded by a highly competitive (14%-acceptance rate) postdoctoral researcher
grant funded by the [Research Council of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/en/). I am a senior member of the
[Constraint Reasoning and Optimization](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization) group led by Professor Matti JÃ¤rvisalo.

A year later, starting on the 1st of September of 2022 I was hired as an University Lecturer
by the same department. Since then, I have been splitting my time between the
postdoctoral position (70%), and the Lecturer position (30%).

## Previous Affiliations & International Research Visits

- Between March and May of 2023 I was a visiting researcher at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, University of California Berkeley (UCB), USA. I participated in the 3-month ["Extended Reunion: Satisfiability"](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/extended-reunion-satisfiability) program. I was invited to the program as one of roughly 40 world-leading researchers in the field.
- Between March and May of 2019 I was a visiting researcher at the University of Toronto in Canada. My visit was hosted by Professor Fahiem Bacchus. The visit was very succesfull, resulting in a best paper award at the 2020 SAT conference.
- Between October and December of 2018 I was a visiting researcher at the University of Melbourne, Australia. My visit was hosted by Professor Peter Stuckey and Emir Demirovic. The visit led to a joint publication at the 2019 CPAIOR conference, which then grew into the maxsat solver [Loandra](/software/).

## Accademic Degrees and Titles

- In 2022 I was awarded a Title of Docent in Computer Science from the University of Helsinki. Docent is an accadmeic title in Finland that roughly corresponds to adjunct professor in the U.S. It is awarded to individuals who have demonstrated an ability to lead research and teach their subject.

- I defended my PhD thesis in computer science in 2018. My PhD-thesis [Solving Optimization Problems via Maximum Satisfiability : Encodings and Re-Encodings](https://helda.helsinki.fi/items/e1c39c7c-c6e2-4e47-b76b-747e4ace524e), was awarded the 2020 [ACP-Doctoral Research award](https://www.a4cp.org/awards/doctoral-research-award).

- I was awarded my M.Sc. in applied mathematics in 2014 from the University of Helsinki.
