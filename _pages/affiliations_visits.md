Since the 1st of September of 2021 I have been working as postdoctoral researcher
at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/computer-science) of the University of Helsinki.
My research is funded by a highly competitive (14%-acceptance rate) postdoctoral researcher
grant funded by the [Research Council of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/en/). I am a senior member of the
[Constraint Reasoning and Optimization](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization) group led by Professor Matti JÃ¤rvisalo.

A year later, starting on the 1st of September of 2022 I was hired as an University Lecturer
by the same department. Since then, I have been splitting my time between the
postdoctoral position (70%), and the Lecturer position (30%).
