The day starts once again in Bats camp. After a night of heightened emotions, the party decides to (for now) leave
the abbot alone and instead travel to western Barovia to deal with Morgantha once and for all.
On their trip, they were joined by Magda, a member of the lost travelers whom the rest of the party seemed to know,
but Cinna did not.

Traveling towards the windmill, the party stops briefly at Vallaki to update Urwin on the current status and their having
received the journal from Argynvostholt. Being in a hurry to catch the sunlight, the party quickly continued along, arriving at the
windmill at the brink of nightfall. Having received word of Morgantha returning to her old home from the crows circling above, the party arrives with caution.

Thanks to the ritual that Xuza and Marillion learned from the journal Geoff received, the party can interrupt Morgantha's attempts to disturb Geoff's sleep. Darren is sent into Geoff's dreams, where he manages to convince Geoff to help himself and push Morgantha away. Meanwhile, the rest of the party manages to beat the remaining life out of Morgantha and make Geoff's life significantly safer.

With the dust settling, the last surprise of the day was revealed. Magda turned into Strahd and invited the group to his wedding, which was to take place in 10 days at the castle. Strahd then took his absence, leaving the party at the ruins of the windmill.
