On my free time I like to play the guitar. For a few years "naughties", I played in a band called Six Minutes. 
We played fairly actively for a few years
before life caught up with us. These days I mainly play with my spouse, which I enjoy tremendously.

Six Minutes left their mark on the internet, you can find us on Spotify.
