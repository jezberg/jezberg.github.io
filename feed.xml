Over the following weeks, I will be traveling quite a lot. Tomorrow, I am going to Brusells to visit Prof. Bart Bogaerts, and the week after that, I’ll be in India for the <a href="https://satisfiability.org/SAT24/">SAT 2024</a>. Finally, in the first week of September, I’ll go to Girona for <a href="https://cp2024.a4cp.org/index.html">CP 24</a>. I am both excited and terrified about the upcoming weeks. I am excited to start my Academy Research Fellowship (/blog/2024/funding/), but terrified about how many hours I’ll spend in an airplane.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/flatanger4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/flatanger4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/flatanger4-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/flatanger4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>During the summer, I went on my first climbing trip.

Flatanger was very beautiful. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes spending time in nature.

The service organizes research visits to classrooms. A teacher can ask for a researcher from a specific subject, after which the coordinator of meet a researcher looks through the pool of interested researchers, and connects a suitable person with the teacher. The teacher then collects questions from their students, and the researcher prepares a 40 minute visit based on those questions. The best part is, the service is free for the teachers!</p> <p>Today I went to visit a classroom in Ruusuvuoren Koulu with just under 10 immigrant students taking preparatory classes in Finnish. It was definitely an interesting glimpse into a world I had not thought too much of before. We talked about what it means to be a researcher, what I study, and what the kids knew about computers. Thanks to the class for having me. I hope I was able to teach the students at least a bit about being a researcher.
