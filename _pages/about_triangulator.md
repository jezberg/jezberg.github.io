## Triangulator

Triangulator is an implementation of the Bouchitt√©-Todinca algorithm for finding minimal graph triangulations that are optimal with respect to different cost function. The approach can be used to solve many different graph-related problems. More precisely, Triangulator can be used for computing the treewidth and minimum fill-in of a graph, the generalized hypertreewidth and fractional hypertreewidth of a hypergraph or the total table size of a Bayesian network. Triangulator placed second in the minimum-fill in track of the 2017 PACE challenge. More details can be found in {% cite DBLP:journals/jea/KorhonenBJ19 DBLP:conf/ijcai/KorhonenBJ19 %}

Triangulator is mainly developed by Tuukka Korhonen, its available in open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Laakeri/Triangulator).
