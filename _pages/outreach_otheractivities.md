# Science Outreach

## Media Appearances

[I was interviewed by the Finish Broadcasting Company on the Trustworthiness of AI]({% post_url 2024-01-26-interviewed %})

## Meet a Researcher

I am currently a board member of Young Academy of Finland in charge of science outreach. As part of that position I am involved with
developing and maintaining the [meet a researcher](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/) initiative that coordinates research visits
to schools. The service is very popular, last year we organized 600 visits and reached over 10 000 students.
In early 2024 I participated in the [EDUCA]({% post_url 2024-01-26-educa %}) convention with the aim of increasing awareness of the service.

## UniJunior

Since 2020 I have been a member of the steering group of [UniJunior](https://www.helsinki.fi/sv/vetenskapsfostran/barn-unga-och-familjer/unijunior)
a cross-disciplinary project led by Professor Gunilla Holm that studies science workshops for children ages 9-12 as learning environments.

We organize about 10 workshops annually for about 20 children of ages 9-12. Each workshops is led by a researcher in some specific subject
and aims at fostering an interest in science in the children. I myself have organized 4 different workshops. More details can be found in the following blog
posts.

# Positions of Trust Based on Scientific Merit
