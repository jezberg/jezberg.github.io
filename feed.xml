The paper is an extension of our <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.SAT.2022.12">SAT</a> paper from 2022.</p> <p>In the paper, we present <a href="https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/bioptsat/src/master/">BiOptSAT</a>, a framework for extending single-objective algorithms for Maximum Satisfiability into the bi-objective setting. In bi-objective optimization, we are looking for a set of solutions that–informally speaking–balance two objectives as well as possible. An example of a bi-objective optimization problem that we often use is the problem of buying a house or an apartment that, on the one hand, should be as close to the center of town as possible but, on the other, should be as affordable as possible. As these two goals conflict, there is no clear single “best” solution. Instead, we seek solutions that can not be improved in “an obvious way”. In other words, we are interested only in houses for which all cheaper options are further away or for which all closer options are more expensive. The paper shows how to solve problems like these with declarative, constraint-based methods.</p> <p>I want to thank all of my co-authors for their excellent work!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="research"/><category term="papers"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Academy Research Fellow</title><link href="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/funding/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Academy Research Fellow"/><published>2024-06-17T10:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-17T10:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/funding</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jeremiasberg.com/blog/2024/funding/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/funding-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/funding-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/funding-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/funding.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> I celebrated by participating in the Lakia Jukola relay.
