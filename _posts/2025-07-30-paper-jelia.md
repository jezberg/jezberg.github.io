I am happy to let you know that our paper _Engineering and Evaluating Multi-objective
Pseudo-Boolean Optimizers_ has been accepted for publication at the [19th edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence](https://viam.science.tsu.ge/jelia2025/).
In the paper, we report on a cross-community evaluation of different approaches for computing pareto-optimal solutions under 0-1 integer linear inequalities. We also build on out [recent TACAS paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-90653-4_6) in order to show
how such solvers can be proof-logged.

I want to thank all of my co-authors, especially my student Christoph Jabs, for their excellent work on the project!
