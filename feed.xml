These conferences are the most central ones in my field with just under 300 people attending in total. For me it was a busy week, with in total 4 papers with my name on them being presented, and me acting as PC chair for SAT. I learned a lot about the inner workings of a conference, but also had a lot of fun meeting up with international colleagues. I also had the opportunity to meet up with an old high-school friend who nowadays works at the same university, and even see the <a href="https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/beth-wants-the-d">Beth Mays</a> one-woman show at the Edinbrugh fringe.</p> <p>I would like to (once again) thank everyone involved in the organization of the conferences.

The aim was to explore the top-rated disc golf courses of Estonia, focusing on courses near Tartu (seeing as the <a href="https://www.discfestival.com/">European Disc Golf Festival 2025</a> was going on in Tallinn).</p> <p>We are all amateurs, so the primary goal of the trip was to have fun and explore some nice courses. From that perspective, the trip was a huge success. We were delighted with the <a href="https://www.hektorstay.com/hostels/en/">Hektor Design Hostel</a> in Tartu, with the nearby restaurants, and the courses we played. The only thing that could have been–slightly–better was the weather, which was either a bit hot for achieving maximal performance on the course, or a bit rainy. But on the whole, a very lovely trip.

Naturvetenskaper Nu is an annual course at the Faculty of Science that invites researchers from the natural sciences to present their research to undergraduate and high-school students. My talk was titled “How can we know if the computer is right?”. The presentation is loosely based on the abstract I wrote for the <a href="https://menejatieda.fi/sv/kan-vi-vara-sakra-pa-att-datorn-har-ratt/">Mene ja Tiedä</a> journal published by the Young Academy of Finland, which in turn is based on our work on certifying the computations of NP-hard optimization procedures (e.g. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-38499-8_1">this paper</a>).</p> <p>I was happy with how the presentation turned out, and I would like to thank the course organizers (mainly Stefan Taubert) for the opportunity, as well as Frida Hartman, who gave the second computer science talk on fairness in AI.

Our topic in the panel was the role of AI in physics and chemistry teaching and research, a subject made even more topical by the announcement of the 2024 Nobel Prize in both chemistry and physics going to work related to AI. My role on the panel was to give an understandable overview of how modern AI (or, more precisely, machine learning) works and its weaknesses regarding the trustworthiness and correctness of the results. You can find my slides below; I am very happy with how the presentation turned out, as many of the participants in the audience seemed to be as well.</p> <p>I would like to thank the conference organizers for the invitation to speak and for a well-organized event. The only thing one could complain about was the extremely strong wind on the way back from Sweden, but as far as I know, physicists and chemists have yet to figure out a way to directly influence the weather on the Ostrobotnian Sea.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQp6L1jFxGZiWoYl73GSPeaB81xCl1SNePn7wYN70miCunqaaTDXfw7LyMr8CXjaf-2fjeZmLdH61OG/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="780" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="events"/><category term="events"/><category term="presentations"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Research for Science Teachers]]></summary></entry></feed>
