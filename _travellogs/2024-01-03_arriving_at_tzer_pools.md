After spending two nights in the town of Barovia, the party woke the next day with plans to travel west to eventually make their way to the vineyard of the Wizard of Wines, where Bart wanted them to get to and maybe find Irena, even if Ismark did not seem too worried about her running away. Before leaving, the group checked on Father Donavich. Arriving at the church, they learned Donavich had also run away from town at night.

After finally hitting the road, the rest of the day was spent traveling west. After a few hours of travel, the "lost travelers" (the name the group had given themselves the day before) came across a set of gallows. While the rest of the group did not think too much about them, Xuza and Marillion were shocked to see visions of being hanged by each other. Somewhat unsettled, the party continued toward the Vistani encampment at Tser Pools as Bart assured them they would be warmly welcomed.

At the encampment, the lost travelers were welcomed by the Vistani
and treated to a night of (relative) peace, songs, and wine. In the songs, the party learned about Barovia's past and the special status that the Vistani enjoy as the only ones allowed to leave. The group was also given audience with Madam Eva, the vistani elder who had told Bart about the arrival of the others a few days prior.
Eva read the fortunes of the group and made some cryptic remarks about what was to come and overthrowing the current rule of the land. She also urged the party to visit the Amber temple during their travels, and especially before facing Strahd.

After drinking varying amounts of wine, the group retired for the night. During the dark hours of the night, both Marillion and Xuza had some unusual dreams.
Marillion dreamt of Xuza killing him, while Xuza was visited by a strange entity who taught him the changedance, a secret ritual of Eilistraee that allows her and her followers to change gender to to get closer to the mother.
