I am a [Research Council of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/en/) post doctoral researcher and an university lecturer at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/computer-science) of the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) and a senior member of the [Constraint Reasoning and Optimization](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/constraint-reasoning-and-optimization) research group.

My research focuses on declarative, constraint-based, approaches and automated reasoning for solving optimization problems. I see my research to lie between theory and practice in that I aim to harness the theory underlying constraint paradigms like Maximum Satisfiability, Pseudo-Boolean Optimization and Constraint Programming toward creating practical tools for solving difficult optimization problems.

I got my M.Sc in applied mathematics in 2014 ande defenden my PhD in computer science in 2018. Both from the University of Helsinki. My PhD-thesis [Solving Optimization Problems via Maximum Satisfiability : Encodings and Re-Encodings](https://helda.helsinki.fi/items/e1c39c7c-c6e2-4e47-b76b-747e4ace524e), was awarded the 2020 [ACP-Doctoral Research award](https://www.a4cp.org/awards/doctoral-research-award).
In 2022 I was awarded a [Title of Docent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docent#Finland) in Computer Science from the University of Helsinki.
