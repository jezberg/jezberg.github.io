I am glad to report that my papers "Ordered Objectives in Maximum Satisfiability", and "Efficient and Reliable Hitting-Set Computations
for the Implicit Hitting Set Approach" were accepted at AAAI 2026 as two of the roughly 4000 papers. Both papers deal with fundamental approaches to combinatorial optimization and how to improve our understanding, efectivenesss and trustworthiness of fundamental AI methods.

I would like to thank all of my coauthors for their work. Once the papers are officially published, I will add links to them on these pages. Before that, you can come to Singapore and talk to us at the posters. See you there!
