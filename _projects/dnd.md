Like so many others I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends. For me the social aspect, i.e. spending time with my friends, of the game is the most important part. However, I also firmly believe that playing DND has taught me numerous useful things about communication
and teaching and honed skills I make use of often in my work as well.

## My (major) Characters - Jockus and Meen'Alith

I have played in a number of one-shots (short, one evening adventures) and two longer campaigns. In "Dragon of Icespire Peak" I played Jockus the halfling bard, a local gardener whose crops were destroyed by a dragon. He teamed up with the dragonborn Yixo, the half-elf Beleg and the bugbear Bandek and managed to kill the dragon, before returning to his quiet life in the town. Jockus was/is a relaxed--and a not too complex--character who liked making puns.

In "Rime of the Frostmaiden" I played Meen'Alith. She was a half-orc Barbarian who was discovering herself in the world and had some trouble
understanding that not all end justify the means. Unfortunately, she lost her life in battle against followers of Aurill.

## My Campaign - Curse of Strahd

In addition to playing in a few campaigns I also enjoy DMing. I am currently DMing Curse of Strahd for a group of 5 adventurers:

- **Darren**, the human fighter who got tricked into Barovia with his squire Geoff. Darren, who initially had apparently been selected by Strahd to be the new ruler of the land has since been challenged with maintaining his values as a knight and keeping Geoff safe in the despotic land of Barovia.
- **Xuza** and **Marillion**, a drow and an asimar who appear to have been called into Barovia not by its ruler Strahd von Zarchovich, but perhaps by something more sinister.
- **Cinnari**, the Kalashtar druid who grew up as the daughter of Strahd, but has since realized that he might not be that nice of a guy.
- **Bartholomew**, the Vistani businessman whose livelihood was disturbed by Strahd cutting off the Vistani people from the outside world.

The journey of the Lost Travellers began with a strange dream in which most of them seemed to get transported into a misty forrest and asked by a couple
of children to clear out their monster-infested house that had its basement in the attic. A few days after that, the party members who did not know each other prior to the events
were independently called into Barovia. These are the tales of their adventures, starting from when they first reunited at the gates of Barovia.
