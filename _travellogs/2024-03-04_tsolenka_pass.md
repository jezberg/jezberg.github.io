In the early morning light, the party set off from Vallaki with the
goal to reach the door of the amber temple the same day.
Using Cinnas aerial talents travel went fast. After just over half a day of travel
the party (flying on Geoff and Cinna) could see the bridge of Tsolenka pass.
Landing on the bridge they immediately got attacked by a statue of a dragon, who seemed
especially interested in preventing Xuza or Marillion from proceeding toward the temple.
The statue attacked, but the party was able to fend it off.

Realising where he was, Marillion was suddenly very interested in getting to the barracks located right
next to the bridge. Entering the building Bart felt a magical aura around the door, but did not think too much of
it at that time. The party soon realised that the Barracks is currently used as Ludmillas laboratory. On the second
floor they found the--barely alive--husk of Halric, an old acquaintance of Darren.
The rest of Halrics life was soon extinguished by Ludmillas fiery precautions were set off by an overly eager druid who wanted to help Halric. Meanwhile, Marillion had made his way up on the roof, where he finally found the sword that had haunted him in his dreams.
The reunion was cut short by Bart suddenly realising that the spell he had felt in the door was an alarm spell, which (correctly)
made the party conclude that they would soon have company. THe party decided to hurry back over the bridge, and toward the temple.

Running over the bridge Xuza was quickly stopped by a hold person spell. Turning around the party was put face-to-face with Volenta Popofsky together with some vampire spawns and aggressions quickly followed. During the battle the party quickly realised the presence of someone else, Barts "see invisibility" spell revealed a fairly fresh thiefling vampire in the form of Cassia who seemed very interested in rummaging through the party's bags in search of something. On her second go Cassia managed to get a hold of Strahds journal, after which she made a quick exit back through the teleportation portal in the barracks (even if Bart did his best to stop her).

The party eventually vanquished Volenta, her weird wolf, and the vampire spawn (some of which met their end falling 500 feet to the river below the bridge). After the dust settled Cinna revealed that the battle had taken enough of a toll on her to prevent reaching the temple the same day. Instead the party put some distance between tsolenka and themselves and set up camp.
The night was interrupted by a big goat who came looking for food. Luckily Cinna managed to calm it down before it decided that the party would make for a dinner.
