The [SAT 2025](https://satisfiability.org/SAT25/) conference was organized at the university of Glasgow between the 10th and 15th of August
together with [CP 2025](https://cp2025.a4cp.org/), and [SoCS 2025](https://socs25.search-conference.org/). These conferences are the most central ones in my field with just under 300 people attending in total. For me it was a busy week, with in total 4 papers with my name on them being presented, and me acting as PC chair for SAT. I learned a lot about the inner workings of a conference, but also had a lot of fun meeting up with international colleagues. I also had the opportunity to meet up with an old high-school friend who nowadays works at the same university, and even see the [Beth Mays](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/beth-wants-the-d) one-woman show at the Edinbrugh fringe.

I would like to (once again) thank everyone involved in the organization of the conferences. Glasgow and the University of Glasgow were wonderful hosts and I recommend both Glasgow, and Beth Mays show wholeheartedly to anyone.
