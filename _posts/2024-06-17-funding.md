I celebrated by participating in the Lakia Jukola relay, slow but steady did not win the race this time, but it did get me to the finnish.

I am happy to announce that the [Research Council of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/) has decided to fund my four-year [Academy Reseach Fellow](https://www.aka.fi/suomen-akatemian-toiminta/ajankohtaista/tiedotteet-ja-uutiset/2024/luonnontieteiden-ja-tekniikan-tutkimuksen-akatemiatutkijat-ja-akatemiahankkeet-on-valittu/) project, ["Cracking the Crux of Combinatorial Optimization."](https://research.fi/en/results/funding/81503). The funding will allow me to pursue my research into practical and trustworthy methods for solving combinatorial optimization problems and applying them toward trustworthy AI.

I am very grateful to the Research Council for its support and look forward to turning that support into world-class research in the next four years. I would also like to thank everyone who helped and supported me with the application.
