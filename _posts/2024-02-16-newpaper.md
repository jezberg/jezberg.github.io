I am happy to let you know that our paper "Core Boosting in SAT-Based Multi-Objective Optimization" has been accepted for publication at
the [21st International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research (CPAIOR)](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2024)
conference.

In the paper, we extend the idea of coore-boosting that I proposed for single-objective optimization in 2019, to the
multio-objective setting. We show that core-boosting significantly improves the performance of several state-of-the-art
approaches to computing pareto-optimal solutions to multi-objective optimization problems. Once the camera-ready paper is submitted, it will be made available on these
webpages as well.

I would like to thank all of my co-authors for their work. Looking forward to going to Uppsala in May.
