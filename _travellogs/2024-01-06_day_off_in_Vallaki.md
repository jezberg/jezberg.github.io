The day was spent in Vallaki, making plans and gathering supplies. In the (very) early morning, Xuza was cooking breakfast when Rictavio, the town half-elf bard who the party had briefly met during the day before, showed up in the kitchen. He prepared an apple and a steak, and claimed he would go eat with Gadof Blinsky, the town toymaker. Even if this was a bit odd, Xuza decided to not investigate and let Rictavio go on his way. Later parts of the morning saw more customers arriving at the Inn, including the Watcher brothers Nikolai and Karl who--against everyones wishes---had once again decided to patronize the tavern.

Heading out from the inn the lost travellers spent the day exploring Vallaki, they learned about an upcomming festival of the blazing sun organized by the town Burgeonmaster in order to keep the vampires at bay and in order to make sure that "all would be well". The festival would be held in three days time and include a tournament of strength with a 1000 gold prize pot. The party decided to enter the tournament and even manage to secure sponsorships from the local stables The Kind Mare and smithy The Cracked Anvil. They also left Darrens swords to be silvered at the smithy, and agreed with Lucian that Goeff would stay for a few days and do some chores in exchange for shelter. Apparently the orphan Freek that the party had rescued was also going to help Lucian at the church.

During the last part of their outing the party visited, the Stockyard, the closest thing Vallaki has to a general store. During their time there, they noticed that Rictavios, very colourful.carnivalwagon seemed to house a Tiger. With some speculations on whether a tiger would be one of the challenges of the tournament, the party spent one more night at the Blue Water Inn, planning the next day to head off to the Wizzard of Wines to finally figure out what is going on there and help Bart get his business up and running. Additionally, the plan at the moment was to stop by in "the house of the dragon" in order to investigate leads on more information on Strahd. Both Urwin and Madam Eva had suggested that there might be something interestign to find and Urwin had promised the loyalty of the keepers of the feather in exchange for information.
