A group of adventures meet up at the eastern gate of Barovia. Marillion and Xuza wake up in an abandoned guardhouse.
Darren and Goeff arrive through the gates that shut immediately after letting them in. The three acquaintances are met by a Barovian sorcerer who introduces himself as Bart and asks them to help him with a problem he is having at the Wineyard. FIially, a familiar Kalshtar druid and her dog reveal themselves and join the party.

The party travelled to the mansion that some of them saw in a dream a few nights ago (the so called Cinnas mansion). At the mansion they found pies that they all eat.with good appetite. On route they also found a note from the burgeonmaster of Barovia, Kolyan Indirovich urging people to stay away.

They travel to the town of Barovia where they temporarily split with Bart who runs of to run errands. The rest of the party headed toward the Burgeonmasters house hoping to find Kolyan Indirovich, the bugeonmaster on whose invitation Darren apparently entered Barovia. They are met instead by a demonstration with the mob outside of the house asking for "the bitch to leave" and Ireena Kolyana, Kolyans daughter in the house. Ireena seems a bit hesitant to let them in. She urges them to seek her brother, Ismark Kol­yanovich who is expected to be int the Blood of Wine Tavern. In the mean time---and after purchasing pies from Morgantha----Cinna has found something of interest in the well in the square. She asks for help in retrieving a golden acorn from one of the (unexpected) zombies from the well. The ensuring combat resulted in enough noice for the townspeople to notice, resulting in the party being arrested after climbing out of the well.

As a consequence, they were brought before Ismark Kol­yanovich who determined them to be mostly harmless. They also found out that Kolyan had died, raising the question of who sent the letter inviting Darren. Ismark has some requests, and asked the party to return the next day.

The day was ended with a reunion at the Blood of Wine Tavern, a recap and some showers, In addition to Bart, the party found a sad woman who did not want to be disturbed (later determined to be Mary), Barts associates Alana Belasco, Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia, as well as the barkeeper Arik. The party checked in to a room, in which the night was spent.
