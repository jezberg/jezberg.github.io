The lost travelers gather allies and prepare to run an ancient ritual designed to imprison a dark power, with the quickly approaching Strahd's wedding looming over them and Irena's fate hanging in the balance. To maximize confusion and their chance of success, the travelers ask Ezmeralda and Rictavio to simultaneously launch an attack on the Strahds Heart of Sorrow, his extra source of life force. They also ask Tepurin the bard to be their eyes on the inside of the castle during the wedding, notifying them of disturbances and the best time to launch the attack. Cinna and Darren also meet with the werewolves and learn that Strahd had coerced them to attend the wedding in order to dispose of the less-wanted guests. Darren pleads for the wolves to ignore this and instead join the assault on Strahd by kidnapping Irena before the wedding and taking her to safety.
During all this, Marillion visits the burgomaster's house to get a doll of Ireena from Izek's room. With the doll in hand, Marillion asks Blinsky to make a life-sized one, hoping to fool at least some vampires Strahd would surely send after the werewolves and the fleeing Irena.

After a long day of planning, the travelers retire for what could be the last night of sleep in a somewhat comfortable bed they would ever get.
