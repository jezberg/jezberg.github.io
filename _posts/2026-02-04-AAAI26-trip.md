At the end of January I visited Singapore for the first time in order to attend [AAAI 2026](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/). I had two accepted papers, I was there to present a poster on our paper on detecting [ordered objectives in MaxSAT](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjarvisa/papers/sbj.aaai26.pdf) and to support my co-author who gave an oral presentation on our paper on [efficient and reliable hitting set computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07015). Additionally, I was invited to give a talk in a workshop on automated reasoning at Nanyang Technological University. There I talked about my more recent work on computing explanations for tree ensembles. I would like thank Yonk Kiam Tan for the invite.

It was my first time visiting both Singapore and AAAI. I am happy with the visit, even if coordinating a conference as large as AAAI has gotten is challening at best. Thanks to the organizers of AAAI and to all colleagues I met in Singapore for the discussions. See you all next time!
