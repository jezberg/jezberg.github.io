The lost travelers gathered allies the next day and prepared to run an ancient ritual designed to imprison a dark power, with Strahd looking down their shoulders. The lost travelers had agreed that Ezmeralda and Rictavio would launch an attack on the Strahds Heart of Sorrow, his extra source of life force. They also asked Tepurin the bard to be their eyes on the inside, notifying them of disturbances. Cinna and Darren also met with the werewolves and learned that Strahd had coerced the werewolves to attend the wedding and dispose of the less-wanted guests. Darren pleaded for the wolves to ignore this and instead join the assault on Strahd by removing Irena from the Castle before the wedding.

Finally, Marillion visited the burgomaster's house to get a doll of Ireena from the former Izek's room. With the doll in hand, Marillion went to Blinshy and asked him to make a life-sized one, hoping to fool at least some vampires Strahd would surely send after the werewolves and the fleeing Irena. After a long day of planning, the travelers retired for what could be the last night of sleep in a bed they would ever get.
