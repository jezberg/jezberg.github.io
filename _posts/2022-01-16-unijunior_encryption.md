The workshop was on different methods of encryption. We had 20 kids divided into 3 groups based on age.
The different groups worked on different encryption methods under the supervision of the brilliant
assistants. In the end we had a puzzle on public key encryption methods.

Thanks to Martina, Oscar, Maria and Sara for the help with organizing.
