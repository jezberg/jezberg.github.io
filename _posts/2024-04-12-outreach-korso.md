Over the last few years I have been involved with [Meet a Researcher](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/) initiative
organized my [Young Academy Finland](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/). The service organizes research visits
to classrooms. A teacher can ask for a researcher from a specific subject, after which the coordinator of meet a researcher
looks through the pool of interested researchers, and connects a suitable person with the teacher. The teacher then collects questions
from their students, and the researcher prepares a 40 minute visit based on those questions. The best part is, the service is free for
the teachers!

Today I went to visit a classroom in Ruusuvuoren Koulu with just under 10 immigrant students taking preparatory classes
in Finnish. It was definitely an interesting glimpse into a world I had not thought too much of before. We talked about what it means to be a researcher, what I study,
and what the kids knew about computers. Thanks to the class for having me. I hope I was able to teach the students at least a bit about being a researcher.
If you are a researcher looking to train your outreach skills, or a teacher looking for connections to the research community, I highly recommend
looking into [meet a researcher](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/). I have had a blast with it.
