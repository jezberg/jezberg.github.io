I was interviewed by the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE) for their Q&AI podcast about AI.
We talked about the (lack of) reliability of AI and what that implies for the future.
I had a blast, thanks to Isak Rautio for having me on.

For those of you in Finland, the podcast can be found on [YLEs website](https://areena.yle.fi/podcastit/1-67412210)
