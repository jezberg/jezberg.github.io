Today and tomorrow I will be representing the [meet a researcher](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/meet-a-researcher/) initiative of [Young Academy of Finland](https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/en/) at
[EDUCA](https://educa.messukeskus.com/?lang=en), the largest convention for the education and training sector in Finland.

Meet a researcher connects researchers with schools. We organize remote visits by researchers to different subjects in primary and secondary schools. More than 500 researchers have signed up as voulenteers and currently we are reaching over 10 000 students annually. The best part, it is free for teachers to use. If you are a teacher in Finland (or in a reasonable timezone for Finnish researchers) you should try it. If you're attending EDUCA tomorrow, you should come say hi.
