The party spent one more night in the town of Barovia, during which they learned that Donavich had apparently also fled the town after last nights happenings. Ismark did not seem to worried about ireena running away, but urged the part to keep an eye out for her during their travels.

In the morning they heard a woman crying in the streets, they were told by Ismark that it is Mary. The party left her be and
decided to get going. The day was spent travelling west from Barovia. In addition to some chit chat, the most notable thing to happen during the travels was that they came upon a gallows on which Xuza and Marrilion had visions of hanging each other, (or more precisely, visions of being hanged by each other). Somewhat unsettled they continued on toward the Tser Pools Encampment where Bart assured them they would be welcomed.

At the encampment the lost travellers were welcomed by the Vistani living there and treated to a night of (relative) peace, songs and merry wine drinking.
The song they heard talked about the past of Barovia and the special status that Vistani enjoy in the area.

The party was also summoned to Madam Eva, the vistani elder who had told Bart about the arrival of the others. She gave some cryptic comments about the characters past and read their fortune. She also urged the party to visit the Amber temple, in case they are interested in ridding Barovia of Strahd for good.

The rest of the night was spent with varying amounts of wine drinking. During the night both Marillion and Xuza had some unusual dreams.
Marillion dreamt of Xuza killing him, while Xuza learned of a ritual related to Eilistraee allowing him to perform a dance that changes their gender.
