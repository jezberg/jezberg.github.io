[Scuttle](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/scuttle/src/main/) and [BiOptSAT](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/bioptsat/src/master/) are two solvers for multiobjective MaxSAT developed in out group. Both solvers compute the so-called pareto-optimal
solutions of multiopbjective MaxSAT isntances. BiOptSAT is an efficient implementation of the so-called lexicographic method for bi-objective problems, first proposed for MaxSAT by our group. Scuttle implements a number of other algorithms first proposed by other groups, including the so called P-minimal algorithm, and a lower-bounding core-guided algorithm.

Both solvers have been mainly developed by my PhD student [Christoph Jabs](https://christophjabs.info/) who wrote [his M.Sc. thesis](https://helda.helsinki.fi/server/api/core/bitstreams/8f2d47b2-be3d-4b58-871a-c95e4bc93fd1/content) on BiOptSAT.
